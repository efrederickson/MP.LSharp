<p>The Expression Tree Visualizer can be used in a debug environment to visualize expressions.  
To use the visualizer the dll generated by the ExpressionTreeVisualizer project must be copied 
to ...\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Visualizers. You may need to create the 
<strong>Visualizers</strong> directory. In pre-Vista 
versions of Windows use the <strong>My Documents</strong> directory rather than <strong>Documents</strong>. 
If you have the rights, you can also copy the file to:

 <strong>...\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers.</strong></p>

<p>This console program provides the ability to host the visualizer outside of Visual Studio
without need to copy the DLL.</p>

<p>The visualizer window sometimes gets hidden if you run this program in console mode. Try
using the GuiHost instead of the ExpressionTreeVisualizerApplication.</p>

<p>For more information, see "How to: Build an Expression Tree" in the documentation.</p>

<p>Many of the LINQ samples require XML files and/or the version of the 
Northwind sample database that is located in the Data sample. If you 
install the Data sample under the same parent folder as the other LINQ 
samples, then the path for the XML files and database file will be 
resolved automatically. Many of the sample files also require the 
ObjectDumper project.</p>
